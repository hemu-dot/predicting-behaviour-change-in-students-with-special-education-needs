#⚡ Predicting Behavior Change in Students with Special Education Needs
multimodal learning analytics · machine learning

A **machine learning–based behavior prediction system** that analyzes **multimodal learning data** to predict whether positive behavior changes in students with Special Education Needs (SEN) are sustained over time. The project is inspired by **research-driven methodologies** in applied behavior analysis (ABA) and educational data science, aiming to support personalized and data-informed interventions.

📌 Features

* Predicts long-term behavior change using ML classification
* Combines educational, environmental, physiological, and motion data
* Implements multiple ML models with performance comparison
* Handles class imbalance using resampling techniques
* Research-backed approach aligned with real-world ABA therapy scenarios
